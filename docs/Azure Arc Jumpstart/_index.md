The following guides will walk you through the process of setting up demos that show how to get started with Azure Arc. They are designed with a "zero to hero" approach in mind and with as much automation as possible. The goal is for you to have a working Azure Arc demo environment spun up in no time so you can focus on showing the core values of the solution.

**Disclaimer: The intention for this repo is to focus on the core Azure Arc capabilities, deployment scenarios, use-cases and ease of use. It does not focus on Azure best-practices or the other tech and OSS projects being leveraged in the guides and code.**
